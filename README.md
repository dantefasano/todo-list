# To-do List Project

This is a **To-do List** app built with React, designed to help you manage tasks effortlessly. Developed as part of the Self-Paced Full Stack Bootcamp at 4Geeks Academy, it allows users to add, delete, and customize tasks with a color picker. All tasks are saved in localStorage, so your list stays intact even after refreshing the page.
